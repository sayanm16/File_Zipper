# File_Zipper
A File Zipper made using Huffmann Algorithm.
This project supports two functions:
1) Encode: Compresses input file passed.
2) Decode: Decompresses Huffman coded file passed back to its original file.


And a constructor which accepts input file and output file. The object of this class can be initiated as follows: huffman h(inputFileName, outputFileName);
